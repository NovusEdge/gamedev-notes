There are currently 2 primary methods in use for taking in player input and using it in the game. For a simple/basic 3D First Person (Shooter) game, the most common inputs include:
1. [[Player Movement#Basic Movement|Walk (WASD/controller stick)]]
2. [[Player Movement#Jumping|Jump]]
3. [[Player Movement#Crouching|Crouch]]
4. [[Player Movement#Sprinting|Sprint]]
5. [[Interaction System |Interact]]
6. [[Camera Movement - Looking |Looking/Camera Movement]] (yes, this is also a kind of movement)


Binding all of these things together gives us a simple character controller, but there are multiple ways of taking in inputs.
