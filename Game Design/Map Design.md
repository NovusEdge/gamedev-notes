Good games always have a few qualities that distinguish them from shit ones. **Good** game maps are...
- ==_Conducive to the gameplay_==. The level design/map-design should _enhance_ the user experience and ideally add to it rather than just be something that defines boundaries to limit player activity.
- ==_Should be visually appealing and should fit the game's overall theme/art-style_==. This is not a really strict guideline, but it's a generally good idea to make the experience consistent. 
- ==_Should be well balanced_==. In simpler terms, the maps should not feel _tedious_ to get through, they should have an adequate level of difficulty, content and... everything. Not too much, not too little. 

All of this also neatly ties into [[Level Design]]. A game does not necessarily need to have a _map_. It may have a map, a common area that you come to view a map, no map at all; the possibilities are endless. One good example of the **no maps** policy are the souls-like games. _Bloodborne_ for example, has no maps, however it conveys the level intent and the positioning of things through story and environment elements. 

Games like No-Man's-Sky are a prime example of good-but-not-great map design. Their maps have a comprehensive detailing mechanism but they can be overwhelming for new players. 

A prime example for ***GOOD*** map design is the maps in _Legend of Zelda_ or in _God Of War 2018_. Both the games had a lot of information represented in the maps, however, they managed to condense it and convey it in a manner that was easier for the target audience to digest and understand. 

Contrary to popular belief and common instruction, good game maps DO NOT _need_ to be _believable_, that's just a consequence of the thematic settings of the game in question. It doesn't need to be _realistic_, that too, is a consequence of the thematic settings of the game in question. i.e.
