Here's Newton's 3 laws of motion:
1. _Every body preserves in its state of rest, or of uniform in a right line, unless it is compelled to change that state by forces impressed thereon._
2. _The alteration of motion is ever proportional to the motive force impressed: and is made in the direction of the right line in which that force is impressed._
3. _To every action there is always opposed an equal reaction: or the mutual actions of two bodies upon each other are always equal, and directed to contrary parts._

## Some Important Derivations

Let us establish some fundamentals:
1. Speed is a scalar quantity that represents the _distance_ traveled by an object per unit time.
2. Velocity
